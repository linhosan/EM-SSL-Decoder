Verify that the private key and main/server certificate match:
	openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in certificate.pem | openssl md5
	openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in ssl.key | openssl md5
The output of these two commands must be exactly the same. If you cannot locate a matching private key to your main/server certificate, you will be required to re-key the certificate by generating a new CSR and/or requesting an updated certificate from your SSL vendor.
